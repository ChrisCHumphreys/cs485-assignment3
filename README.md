# CS485 Assignment 3 - Threads

## Description
  This is my submission for assignment 3 in CS485.  This program consists of two
  distinct but separate modes that correspond with the questions posed in the 
  assignment.  For example, mode 1 meets the requirements of the first question
  while mode 2 is met by running the program in 2 mode.  Additionally, I have
  included two different files 1.txt and 2.txt which are sample outputs of each
  of these separate modes.
  
  Both of the modes demonstrate the creation of threads, their usage, and then
  their destruction after they are done being used.  In mode 2 mutual exclusion 
  is used as well.
